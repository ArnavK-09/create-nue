# Creating new templates

First and foremost: thank you for helping with Nue! ❤️❤️


### Most important

If you are adding a new template or a feature, please _discuss it first_ by creating a new issue.


### Formatting rules
Please try to use the original style in the codebase. Do not introduce new rules or patterns. The most notable rules are:

1. No semicolons, because it's redundant

2. Strings with single quotes

3. Indent with two spaces

4. Prefer `==` over `===`. Only strict equality only when truly needed, which is rarely

5. HTML tag names with lowercase (obviously)
