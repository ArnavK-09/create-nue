# The real badass motherfucking website
You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. But let me describe the real perfect-ass website which beats all of the past motherfuckingwebsites.

## WTMF is this?
You think your 4.99KB https://thebestmotherfucking.website/ is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster. Well, guess what, you're WRONG, motherfucker.


## This motherfucker rules them all
Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past motherfuckingwebsites:

Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)
The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the Google home page
Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)
Looks almost the same on every screen
Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem well, kind of
It's accessible, so everyone can enjoy it but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible
Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an ARPANET website
Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use IPoAC
Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans" which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf
It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
Doesn't include any tracking service this website does, but hey, I gotta see who visits me!
Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.
Use some fucking colors.
Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a nice color
